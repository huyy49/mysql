# Node.js & MySQL

### Overview
This Node.js & MySQL module will first show the home page with all products that are currently available in a table view, then it will ask the users what the next step will be. If they choose to order producs, it will prompt with which product they would like to order, and will update the MySQL database accordingly. If they choose to view products, the table of all products will display again. They will quit the module if the choice is "Quit".
